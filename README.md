#Super Retro Tic Tac Toe 



## What is Super Retro Tic Tac Toe? 

This game is an ultimate tic tac toe, which is a tic tac toe whose squares are smaller tic tac toe boards. When you play in a part of a small board, your opponent has to play in the corresponding small board (for example, if you play in the top left square, your opponent has to play their next move in the top left board). 

This game is designed to be played on a Raspberry Pi with a camera. 

Our version of the ultimate tic tac toe is arcade themed, with handmade pixel arts and music made by our team! The only parts we didn't make ourselves are the initial code of the game, which was provided to us by our teachers, and the sound effects. 

It also uses hand tracking to play it, and has an AI you can play as or against both in local and in online mode. You can play it against other devices with the same communication protocol. 

## Who are we? 

We are Sean Rolly, Youri Halmaert, Manon Galtier and Lilian Varinot (and Nils Deghilage). 

Manon was in charge of the user interface, Youri (and Nils) were in charge of the AI, Sean was in charge of the object tracking and Lilian was responsible for the communication. 

Let's also not forget our tutor for this project, Ludovic Apvrille!

## FAQ

> What do I do if my hand is not detected? 

Try to have a uniform, light background and to play in a well-lit room. You can also try your other hand, get your hand out of frame and get it back in it or move your hand back and forth until it is detected. Once it is detected, as long as it stays in frame, it stays detected most of the time. 

> What makes your arcade theme so different from other similar themes? 

We made the designs and musics ourselves, and the musics were made using a software replicating the way music for actual arcade machines was made. We used the code provided by our teachers for the base game and we used pre-made sound effects, but everything else was custom-made for this game specifically! We also give the player many customization options such as dark or light mode, fullscreen or not for the menus outside of the game, the way you want to do the handtracking... Our game is made for you to enjoy, so we gave you options to make it to your liking!
