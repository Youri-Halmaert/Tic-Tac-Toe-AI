Here are the SDGs our team is in compliance with:
5: gender equality 
-	Showing young girls women can do computer science too 
-	Having a team with a woman on it (in a management position, no less!)
7: affordable and clean energy 
-	Using green transportation to work on the project, working remotely 
-	Using green electricity to produce and run the code weâ€™re using 
12: responsible consumption and production 
-	Reusing a Raspberry Pi we used for another project 
16: peace, justice and strong institutions + 10: reduced inequalities 
-	Promote inclusion by making a device anyone can use and play on (you don't need to have good motor skills, and can choose the hand position you prefer to click!)
